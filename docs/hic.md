# Metagenomic HiC

## What is Metagenomic HiC?

As the name suggest, Metagenomic Hi-C incorporates a new form of sequencing datas, named Hi-C, in to traditional shotgun metagenomes. In doing so, modern analyses, such as genome binning, can be performed accurately and precisely using only a single time-point.

The Hi-C protocol was designed to capture genome-wide evidence of DNA molecules in close physical proximity _in vivo_, prior to cellular lysis. With the flexible nature of a chromosome and its capacity to bend back on itself, the most frequently captured interactions are usually those between loci on the same chromosome. After this, the most frequently observed interactions are inter-chromosomal. Lastly come inter-cellular interactions, which are often far below the rates of those found within a cell.

The original purpose of Hi-C was to study the 3-dimensional conformation of the human genome (Lieberman-Aiden 2009), but the proximity information can just as well be exploited to infer which DNA assembly fragments belong together in a bin.  Depending on the subject of study, the implied precision of "together" can range from a genome to chromosome. For metagenomic studies, methods currently aim to associate assembly fragments believed to come from the same genome.
