With the flexible nature of a chromosome and its capacity to bend back on itself, the most frequently captured interactions are usually those between loci on the same chromosome. After this, the most frequently observed interactions are inter-chromosomal. Lastly come inter-cellular interactions, which are often far below the rates of those found within a cell.\n\n\nThe original purpose of Hi-C was to study the 3-dimensional conformation of the human genome [1], but the proximity information can just as well be exploited to infer which DNA assembly fragments belong together in a bin.
